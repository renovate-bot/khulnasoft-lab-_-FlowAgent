## Make a Pull Request

If you have some changes, you can make a pull request to let FLOWAGENT be better!

### Commit Convention

This project uses the
[commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) to lint
commit.

Please follow the [conventional](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
to add the commit messages.

We use the [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) to check the commit
message before every commit action.

### Steps to PR

1. Fork of the repository and clone your fork
2. Create a new branch out of the `develop` branch. We follow the convention
   `[type/scope]`. For example `fix/accordion-hook` or `docs/menu-typo`. `type`
   can be either `docs`, `fix`, `feat`, `build`, or any other conventional
   commit type. `scope` is just a short id that describes the scope of work.
3. Make and commit your changes following the `Commit Convention`, As you
   develop, you can run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm lint` to make sure everything
   works as expected. Please note that you might have to run `yarn` first in
   order to install all dependencies.
4. We have a pull request template, you only need to add some necessary info to
   let others know what this pr does.

### Some Rules

1. We need complete unit testing, so please check your test code before
   committing.
2. Try not to reduce unit test coverage.
